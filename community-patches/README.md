# A place to find patches that are maintained by the community before myself :frog:

If you have rebased, updated, improved, or found something interesting regarding any of these, feel free to share with a PR ;)

The rules to make community patches are the same as target's userpatches (extension defines how the patch is applied).

**You can enable one or multiple patches for their respective target in the .cfg file of the target itself, using the _community_patches option (more detail in the .cfg's)**
