# Winetricks

- With the required fix for sound on fortnite (also for Unreal Tournament pre-alpha, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice and probably others) - you need to install xact with this winetricks version
- .NET 4.7.1 added, with workarounds for a (mostly) working x64 install

So you don't ask me for the 1000th time :D
