# linux419-TkG config file
# Ryzen Desktop


#### MISC OPTIONS #### 

# External config file to use - If the given file exists in path, it will override default config (customization.cfg) - Default is ~/.config/frogminer/linux419-tkg.cfg
_EXT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/frogminer/linux419-tkg.cfg

#### KERNEL OPTIONS ####

# Name of the default config file to use from the linux???-tkg-config folder. Arch default is "config.x86_64" and Arch hardened is "config_hardened.x86_64".
_configfile="config.x86_64"

# Disable some non-module debugging - See PKGBUILD for the list
_debugdisable="false"

# LEAVE AN EMPTY VALUE TO BE PROMPTED ABOUT IT AT BUILD TIME

# Set to "true to disable FUNCTION_TRACER/GRAPH_TRACER, lowering overhead but limiting debugging and analyzing of kernel functions - Kernel default is "false"
_ftracedisable="false"

# Set to "true" to disable NUMA, lowering overhead, but breaking CUDA/NvEnc on Nvidia equipped systems - Kernel default is "false"
_numadisable="false"

# Set to "1" to use CattaRappa mode (enabling full tickless), "2" for tickless idle only, or "0" for periodic ticks.
# Full tickless can give higher performances in various cases but, depending on hardware, lower consistency. Just tickless idle can perform better on some platforms (mostly AMD based).
_tickless="1"

# Set to "true" to use explicit preemption points to lower latency at the cost of a small throughput loss - Can give a nice perf boost in VMs - Kernel default is "false"
_voluntary_preempt="false"

# A selection of patches from Zen/Liquorix kernel and additional tweaks for a better gaming experience (ZENIFY) - Default is "true"
_zenify="true"

# compiler optimization level - 1. Optimize for performance (-O2); 2. Optimize harder (-O3); 3. Optimize for size (-Os) - Kernel default is "2"
_compileroptlevel="2"

# Make IRQ threading compulsory (FORCE_IRQ_THREADING) - MuQSS only - Default is "false"
_irq_threading="false"

# SMT (Hyperthreading) aware nice priority and policy support (SMT_NICE) - Kernel default is "true" - You can disable this on non-SMT/HT CPUs for lower overhead
_smt_nice="true"

# Trust the CPU manufacturer to initialize Linux's CRNG (RANDOM_TRUST_CPU) - Kernel default is "false"
_random_trust_cpu="false"

# CPU scheduler runqueue sharing - No sharing (RQ_NONE), SMT (hyperthread) siblings (RQ_SMT), Multicore siblings (RQ_MC), Symmetric Multi-Processing (RQ_SMP), NUMA (RQ_ALL)
# Valid values are "none", "smt", "mc", "smp", "all" - Kernel default is "mc"
_runqueue_sharing="mc"

# Timer frequency - "500", "750" or "1000" - More options available in kernel config prompt when left empty depending on selected cpusched - Kernel default is "750"
_timer_freq="500"

# Default CPU governor - "performance", "schedutil" or leave empty for default (tweaked ondemand on AMD and legacy Intel, pstates on modern Intel)
_default_cpu_gov="performance"


#### USER PATCHES ####

# You can use your own patches by putting them in the same folder as the PKGBUILD and giving them the .mypatch extension.
# You can also revert patches by putting them in the same folder as the PKGBUILD and giving them the .myrevert extension.

# Also, userpatches variable below must be set to true for the above to work.
_user_patches="true"

# Apply all user patches without confirmation - !!! NOT RECOMMENDED !!!
_user_patches_no_confirm="false"
